	/**
	 * Convergents of e
	 * Problem 65
	 *
	 * The square root of 2 can be written as an infinite continued fraction.
	 *
	 * Hence the sequence of the first ten convergents for âˆš2 are:
	 * 1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, 41/29, 99/70, 239/169, 577/408, 1393/985, 3363/2378, ...
	 *
	 * What is most surprising is that the important mathematical constant,
	 * e = [2; 1,2,1, 1,4,1, 1,6,1 , ... , 1,2k,1, ...].
	 *
	 * The first ten terms in the sequence of convergents for e are:
	 * 2, 3, 8/3, 11/4, 19/7, 87/32, 106/39, 193/71, 1264/465, 1457/536, ...
	 *
	 * The sum of digits in the numerator of the 10th convergent is 1+4+5+7=17.
	 *
	 * Find the sum of digits in the numerator of the 100th convergent of the continued fraction for e.
