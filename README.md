
About the solutions

For this repository I aimed to use the new java 8 functionalities, primarily streams and lambdas.
All of the libraries are written by me as needed, and being refined while I move forward with the problems.
I aimed to make the solutions optimized via pure mathematical methods (decreasing the problem space,
finding a faster algorithm) and not primarily by programming (however I use parallelized streams if the
workload size makes it viable).

About Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more
than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods,
the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to
delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.

Who are the problems aimed at?

The intended audience include students for whom the basic curriculum is not feeding their hunger to learn,
adults whose background was not primarily mathematics but had an interest in things mathematical,
and professionals who want to keep their problem solving and mathematics on the cutting edge.
